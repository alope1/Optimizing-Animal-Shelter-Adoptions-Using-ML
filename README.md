# Optimizing-Animal-Shelter-Adoptions-Using-ML
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting outcomes for animals in the Austin Animal Center. The project evaluates several machine learning algorithms to determine which provides the best performance.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The project starts with an exploration of three different datasets to evaluate their usefulness for the project. The datasets are examined based on factors like the number of rows and relevant features. The dataset from the Austin Animal Center is ultimately chosen due to its high number of records and relevant features.

## Models and Methodology
The project explores multiple machine learning algorithms, including:

• Random Forest Classifier

• Gradient Boosting Classifier

• Logistic Regression

• Support Vector Machines

Each model undergoes a building phase and an evaluation phase, with some models refined further by techniques like SMOTE to handle class imbalance. The Support Vector Machines model is built using a linear kernel and evaluated on multiple metrics.

## Evaluation and Results
The models are evaluated based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC score. The project explores different strategies to improve model performance, such as removing less relevant classes or balancing the class distribution.

## Conclusion
The project concludes with a recommendation on which model is most effective for predicting outcomes for animals in the Austin Animal Center. The choice is made based on a combination of metrics and model performance.
