# Optimizing-Animal-Shelter-Adoptions-Using-ML
## Animal Shelter Adoption Predictor
### Project Overview
This project focuses on using machine learning to predict if animals will be adopted within 30 days from a shelter. The goal is to help shelters manage their resources better and focus more on animals that need extra help finding homes.


## Objective
Our objective was to use predictive analytics to improve animal welfare by making shelters more efficient. Our model predicts adoption outcomes and highlights factors that affect these outcomes, helping shelters tailor their care and adoption plans.

## Data
We use intake and outcome data from a public animal shelter. The dataset includes details like animal type, condition at intake, age at intake, and other factors, all preprocessed and encoded for the model.
